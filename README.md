# 🛠️ Trace Template Skill

This is a minimal, production-ready template for building **Trace Skills**. It includes everything you need to handle background events (Webhooks) and voice-native interactions (MCP).

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Setup
```bash
mkdir trace_skill
cd trace_skill
git clone git@github.com:EndlessRiverAI/trace-template-skill.git
cd trace-template-skill
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in your `TRACE_HMAC_SECRET` in `.env` once you register your skill.

### 2. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
In a separate terminal, expose your local server to the internet using **localhost.run**:
```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 nokey@localhost.run
```
*Take note of the `https` URL localhost.run provides (e.g., `https://21231e1.localhost.run`).*

## 📝 Manifest & Registration

Your skill is defined by the `manifest.json`. You must submit this manifest via the **Trace Developer Dashboard**.

### Key Fields:
- **`name`**: Human-readable name of your skill.
- **`interface`**: `hybrid` allows both Webhooks and MCP.
- **`triggers`**: Defines what events your skill "listens" to. By default, it listens to `interaction.dialog` (voice).
- **`permissions`**: List of permissions your skill needs. Common ones:
    - `notification.send`: (Implicit) Ability to sent toasts/TTS.
    - `user.profile.read`: Ability to see the user's name.
    - `user.location.read`: Ability to see city/country/GPS.
- **`domains`**: Natural language descriptions that tell the Trace Router when to send an event to your skill.
- **`allowedTools`**: Declares which platform-managed tools (like `mail.send`) your skill can use.

### Registration Steps:
1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Skills** → **Create New Skill**.
2. Paste your localhost.run URL into the **Webhook** and **MCP** endpoint fields.
3. Use the contents of `manifest.json` as a guide for your configuration.
    Sample manifest for this skill:
     ```jsx
    {
      "name": "Template Skill",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "interface": "hybrid",
      "endpoints": {
        "webhook": "https://your-domain.localhost.run/webhook",
        "mcp": "https://your-domain.localhost.run/mcp"
      },
      "triggers": [
        { "channel": "interaction.dialog", "routing_mode": "active" }
      ],
      "domains": {
        "general": "Handle general greetings and tests for the template skill. Match utterances like 'test template' or 'hello from template'."
      },
      "permissions": [
        "notification.send",
        "user.profile.read",
        "user.location.read"
      ],
      "allowedTools": [
        "mail.send"
      ],
      "data_retention": {
        "max_days": 30,
        "deletion_webhook": "https://your-domain.localhost.run/delete-user"
      }
    }
    ```
4. **Save** and copy the **HMAC Secret** into your `.env` file.

## 🔌 Using Platform Actions

This template shows you how to return **responses** that trigger actions on the user's glasses:

- **Notifications**: Toast messages and TTS.
- **Feed Items**: Logging activity to the daily feed.
- **Platform Tools**: Sending emails or creating calendar events via `tool_call`.

Check `src/index.ts` to see how these are constructed.

---

## 🔒 Security

- **HMAC Verification**: All requests from Trace are signed. The `src/hmac.ts` utility ensures only legitimate Trace events are processed.
- **Proxy IDs**: `user.id` is a stable, unique proxy for that specific user. Use it as a primary key in your database.
- **User Info**: If you have the right permissions, the `user` object will contain `name`, `timezone`, and `location`. Timezone and Locale are always provided.

## 🚢 Deployment

Ready to go live? Check out the `deploy.sh` script for instructions on deploying to **Railway** or **Vercel**.

1. Deploy your server.
2. Get the new production URL.
3. Update your endpoints in the **Trace Developer Dashboard**.
